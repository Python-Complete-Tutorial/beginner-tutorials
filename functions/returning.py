# Functions that "return" values
#################################################

# As you might have noticed, the functions that we used from Python
# can sometimes give a value back. This is called a "return" value.
# We can use the return value to do something else.

# Let's write a function that returns a value. This gives the caller
# of the function the opportunity to do whatever they want with the value.
# Take the name, and make every other letter capitalized.
