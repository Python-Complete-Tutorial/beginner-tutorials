# While Loops - A way to repeat code while a condition is true

# Skeleton of a while loop
# while condition:
#   code to run

# Infinite loop
while True:
    print("Hello World!")

# It is important to put a condition in while loop
# that will eventually become false or at least manually break out at some point
